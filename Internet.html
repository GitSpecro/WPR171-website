        <h1>HISTORY OF THE INTERNET</h1>
        <p>
          The internet has undergone a profound evolution that spans several decades, and it can be traced all the way from the 1960s to present day.

        <h2>Key Milestones of the Internet:</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>1960s - ARPANET's Inception:</strong><br>The U.S. Department of Defense's Advaned Research Projects Agency (ARPA) created ARPANET, a network designed to connect computers at various research institutions. This marked the birth of packet-switching technology, where data is broken into packets and sent independently to its destination. In 1969, the first successful transmission of data occurred between two geographically distant computers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1970s - TCP/IP Development:</strong><br>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) were developed by Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn, most often called the fathers of the Internet. TCP/IP provided a common language for different computers to communicate over different networks, allowing for the extension of the internet's capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>980s - NSFNET and Commercialization:</strong><br>The National Science Foundation (NSF) established NSFNET, a high-speed backbone network, in 1986. This laid the groundwork for the internet to grow beyond research institutions. The 1980s also introduced commercial internet service providers (ISPs) and the World Wide Web project, which was proposed by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, which also introduced the concept of web pages and hyperlinks. Tim Burnes-Lee also coined the “Web 1.0” for the first time in 1889.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>1990s - Commercial and Global Expansion:</strong><br>In the 1990s, a rapid increase in internet adoption, both for academic and commercial purposes, was expanded upon. The graphical web browser, known as Mosaic, was released in 1993, making the web more accessible to non-technical users. The term “surfing the web” became more popular as people explored websites using browsers like Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer. E-commerce, email, and online communities also gained prominence during this period.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2000s - Dotcom Bubble and Web 2.0:</strong><br>The early 2000s introduced the “dotcom bubble”, a speculative bubble involving numerous internet-based companies. However, the internet continued to evolve, with the rise of “Web 2.0”, which is characterized by user-generated content, social media platforms, and web applications that are interactive. During this time, services like Wikipedia, YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter also emerged.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2010s - Mobile Internet and Cloud Computing:</strong><br>The increase of smartphones and mobile devices in the 2010s led to a new era of mobile internet usage. Cloud computing also became a key enabler of online services, offering scalable storage and computing resources. The concept of the "Internet of Things" (IoT) was more explored as more devices became connected to the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2020s and Beyond - Continued Evolution:</strong><br>The internet continues to evolve with advancements in artificial intelligence, virtual reality, augmented reality, and more. The advancement of high-speed broadband and the ongoing development of 5G technology are expected to further enhance how we connect and interact via the internet.

        <h1>INTERNET PROTOCOLS:</h1>
        <p>
          Internet protocols are sets of rules that govern how data is communicated between devices across networks. This ensures reliability and efficiency in the transfer of data. 
          There are many different types of protocols which are used in different areas within the internet.
        </p>
        <h2>Some Key Internet Protocols:</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):</strong><br>TCP is a connection-oriented protocol responsible for ensuring reliable and ordered data delivery between devices. It breaks down data into packets, assigns sequence numbers to them, and handles acknowledgment and retransmission mechanisms to guarantee that data arrives intact and in the correct order.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Internet Protocol (IP):</strong><br>IP is responsible for addressing and routing packets of data across networks. It assigns unique IP addresses to devices and uses these addresses to route data from the source all the way to the destination across the internet. There are two main versions of IP, namely IPv4 and IPv6, with IPv6 designed to address the limitations of IPv4's address space.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP):</strong><br>HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It defines how web browsers and web servers communicate to request and deliver web pages and other resources. HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is an extension of HTTP that adds a layer of encryption for secure data transmission.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>File Transfer Protocol (FTP):</strong><br>FTP is a standard protocol used for the transfer of computer files from a server to a client. It provides methods for uploading, downloading, and managing files on remote servers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP):</strong><br>SMTP is used for sending and relaying email messages between email servers. It defines how email clients and servers communicate to deliver messages to recipients.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3):</strong><br>POP3 is used by email clients to retrieve emails from a mail server. It allows users to download messages to their local devices for offline access.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP): </strong><br>IMAP is another protocol used by email clients to access email messages from a server. Unlike POP3, IMAP makes it possible for users to manage their emails on the server while synchronizing changes with the client.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP):</strong><br>SNMP is used to manage and monitor network devices and their performance. It enables administrators to gather information, configure settings, and receive notifications from network devices.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Domain Name System (DNS):</strong><br>DNS translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers use to locate resources on the internet. It acts as a phonebook for the internet, converting memorable domain names into numerical IP addresses.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP):</strong><br>DHCP is used to automatically assign IP addresses, subnet masks, and other network configuration parameters to devices on a network. It simplifies the process of connecting devices to a network by eliminating manual IP configuration.
