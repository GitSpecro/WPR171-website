        <h1>WEB APPLICATION ARCHITECTURE, AND CLIENT-SIDE AND SERVER-SIDE ENGINEERING</h1>
        <p>
          A web application architecture is a layout with all the software components (such as databases, applications, and middleware) and how they communicate with each other. It encompasses the various components, technologies, and interactions that make up a web application and defines how the data is delivered through HTTP, while ensuring that the client-side server and the backend server can understand. Moreover, it also secures that valid data is present in all user requests. It creates and manages records while providing permission-based access and authentication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Client-side and server-side engineering are two essential parts of the process if it comes to web development that work together to create functional and interactive web applications. These terms refer to the different aspects of web development that occur on the client side (the user's device or browser) and the server side (the remote computer or server that hosts the web application).

        <h2>3 Core Components that a Web-Based Application Architecture Typically Comprises:</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>1. Web Browser:</strong><br>The web browser is the front-end component that interacts with the user, receives the input, and manages the presentation logic while controlling user interactions with the application. It renders and displays the web application's UI.by interpreting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render web pages and execute client-side code.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>2. Web Server:</strong><br>The web server also known as the backend component, or the server-side component is responsible for handling incoming HTTP requests from clients (web browsers) and delivering responses to the right component, and therefore manages the entire application operations. It can run and oversee requests from a wide variety of clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>3. Database Server:</strong><br>The database server provides the required data for the web application. It is responsible for storing, managing, and retrieving data used by the web application. In a multi-tiered architecture, database servers can manage business logic with the help of stored procedures.

          <h2>3-Tier Architecture:</h2>
          <p>
            Three-tier architecture, also known as three-tier application architecture, is a widely used software architecture pattern that seperates an application into three interconnected and divided tiers or layers. Each layer serves a specific role in the application, and this separation helps improve scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. The three layers are typically referred to as the Presentation Layer, Bussiness Logic Layer, and Data Storage Layer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>1. Presentation Layer:</strong><br>The Presentation Layer, also known as the user interface layer, is the topmost layer of the architecture. Its primary role is to provide a user-friendly interface for interaction between users and the web application. This layer includes components such as web browsers, mobile apps, or desktop interfaces. It's responsible for rendering data from the Business Logic Tier in a user-friendly manner and collecting user input for further processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>2. Business Logic Tier:</strong><br>The Business Logic Layer, often referred to as the application or middle layer, serves as the core of the application. It contains the business logic and application-specific functionality. This layer processes requests from the Presentation Layer, executes business rules, coordinates data flow, and enforces security methods. It is where web application logic is encapsulated, ensuring data integrity and consistency while also enabling the decoupling of the user interface from the underlying data storage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>3. Data Storage Layer:</strong><br>At the foundation of the three-tier architecture lies the Data Storage Layer, responsible for managing and storing the web application's data. It includes databases, file systems, or any data storage mechanisms needed for persistence. This layer handles data retrieval, storage, update, and deletion operations as requested by the Business Logic Layer. Ensuring data durability, consistency, and security is critical in this layer, as it defines the foundation upon which the entire web application relies for accurate and reliable data access and storage.
